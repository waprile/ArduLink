ArduLink
========

A library (for now just a chunk of code) to send and receive data over an optical link. It uses Manchester Differential Encoding and one interrupt for receiving. Sending uses no interrupts but only delay.

Possible future work: 
 other types of line code
	UWB like
	OOK with start and stop bits
